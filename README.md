Hello. This virtual ATM Machine was designed and created for a project in Programming 2 during the spring of 2023. 
It includes required concepts such as concurrency, encapsulation, and inheritance, as per the object-oriented
programming focus of the course. 

This code does not represent a functional virtual ATM machine, but its importance was moreso in representing
understanding of the concepts which define object-oriented programming and part of a larger report on the 
course's topics.
